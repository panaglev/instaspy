## Description

**Act like you don't see me, we'll play pretend**
This tool is litteraly your ex's best friend to spy on you. Why? This tool will help you to spy on a people instagram stories. Once new image have been added you will be informed with telegram message. You will recieve image itself and line telling whom this picture is posted by(inst: *username*). Pretty minimalist huh?
